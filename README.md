# angular-oauth2-cognito

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-oauth2-cognito)

### LogIn and Logout functionality on Angular 9 with NGRX and Oauth2 auth flow with PKCE, without using Amplify.

PKCE is implemented persisting and retrieving the verifier in localStorage.
For a smooth complete localStorage implementation, please refer to https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-ngrx-material-starter , all credits to the awesome contributors that built it, I merely used their idea and simplified it for making this particular example easier to understand.
